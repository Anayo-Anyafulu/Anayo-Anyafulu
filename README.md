## 🧑‍💻 About Me
I’m a backend-focused engineer who discovered programming in high school while preparing for an IGCSE exam — and that single spark turned into a long-term obsession with building systems that *make sense*.

I enjoy building things that feel:
- **Clean**
- **Fast**
- **Intentional**

Outside of pure backend work, I explore ideas that mix systems, creativity, and experimentation.

**Things I genuinely enjoy**
- 🎮 Story-driven & open-world games  
- 🎬 Movies and long-form series  
- 🧪 Experimenting with random technical ideas  
- 💻 Designing backend systems and developer tools  

---

## 🧠 Currently Exploring
- **Rust** — ownership, lifetimes, CLI tools, systems thinking  
- **Backend architecture** — cleaner Spring Boot patterns and structure  
- **AI fundamentals** — practical use cases for developer workflows  
- **2D game development** — mechanics, loops, and experimentation (for fun)  

---

## 🎯 Philosophy & Direction
I don’t build projects just to “fill a portfolio”.

I build things I’m curious about — tools, systems, or experiments that help me:
- Think more clearly  
- Understand systems deeper  
- Explore ideas end-to-end  

Whether it’s a Java backend, a Rust CLI, or a small game prototype, the goal is always **learning through building**.

## 🔧 Currently Building

### 🦀 RustTorrent
A BitTorrent-inspired peer-to-peer file distribution system built in Rust to explore networking, concurrency, and protocol design.

**Focus**
- File chunking and hashing  
- Peer-to-peer communication over TCP  
- Concurrent piece downloads  
- Data integrity verification  

> A learning-first systems project, prioritizing correctness and clarity over full protocol completeness.

---

### 📰 Daily Digest
A personal daily entertainment and developer news digest designed as a clean, read-only experience.

**What it covers**
- 🎬 Movies & series  
- 🎮 Games  
- 🧑‍💻 Developer & tech news  

**Tech direction**
- Spring Boot for aggregation and APIs  
- Rust for content processing and tooling  
- Optional AI for summarization and relevance ranking  

> Built for personal use, inspired by how developers consume Reddit, newsletters, and media updates daily.

---

## 🚀 Selected Projects
- **Spring Boot Movie API**  
  REST-focused backend exploring clean structure and data flow
