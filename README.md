## 🧑‍💻 About Me
I'm a backend engineer who discovered programming in high school while preparing for an IGCSE exam — and that single spark turned into a passion that’s still growing today.

I love:
- 🎮 Gaming  
- 🎬 Movies  
- 📺 Series  
- 🧪 Experimenting with random tech ideas  
- 💻 Building systems that feel clean, fast, and meaningful  

Currently exploring:
- Rust basics (slow and steady)
- A secret early-stage startup idea 👀  
- 2D game dev (just for fun and chaos)
- AI concepts that can improve backend workflows

---

## 🧠 Currently Learning
- Rust (ownership, lifetimes, CLI experiments)
- AI + ML fundamentals  
- Game dev foundations (2D mechanics, design loops)
- Deeper Spring Boot backend patterns  

---

## 🎯 My Mission
Build things I genuinely enjoy — projects that reflect creativity, structure, and curiosity.  
Whether it’s a Java backend, a Rust experiment, or a tiny game prototype.

---

## 🚀 Featured Projects
- **Spring Boot Movie API** — simple but clean backend structure  
- **Spring Boot Mini Services** — learning micro patterns  
- **Rust CLI Tests** — learning Rust through tools  
- **2D Game Prototype** — chaotic WIP, but fun practice  
- (**More coming — especially once the startup idea forms**)  

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap
- Strengthen Rust fundamentals  
- Build at least one playable 2D game  
- Launch more backend-focused projects  
- Explore AI for practical developer workflows  
- Continue improving Java + Spring Boot mastery
